    <h1>Two Tastes of Healthy and Hearty</h1>
    <p>South Korea is well-known for its numerous and fast-moving trends. Down the alleys and around the streets, convenience stores sell all types of meal kits and stores fusion new combinations of foods to become the next coveted treat. 
Below are two examples of delicious foods that can be found in South Korea - a mixture of sweet, savory, warm, and soothing! </p>
  
    <h2>Into the Past: Haesintang</h2> 
    <p> From the knowledge I've acquired over the years from my parents, <b>Haesintang (해신탕)</b> is a traditional Korean dish that is packed with healthy ingredients. Bordering along the lines of seafood and ginseng chicken, this thick soup dish often has abalone, shrimp, octopus, chicken meat, jujube, and a variety of mushrooms and herbs.
  The most common type of mushrooms included in this dish is the enoki mushrooms, but the lion's mane mushroom is also an additional option. (Fun fact: the name of the lion's mane mushroom in Korean actually translates to "roe deer's bottom" because its fuzzy characteristic was thought to have a resemblance!)</p>

  <p>Being a warm dish boiled in hot water, this dish may seem perfect for the freezing winters, but this dish is actually often eaten during the summer as a "medicine food" to recharge energy and boost stamina in the hot weather.</p>
